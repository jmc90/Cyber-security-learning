# Professional Statement

I bring a strong investigative background, attention to detail, and a 
commitment to integrity developed through my experience in law 
enforcement. I value protecting others, continuous learning, and 
maintaining high standards of professionalism. I am excited to apply these 
strengths to cybersecurity by identifying threats, mitigating risks, and 
supporting organizations in protecting their data and maintaining secure 
environments.
