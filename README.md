# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Cybersecurity Learning Repository** 👋  
This repository documents my structured transition from a career in law enforcement to the field of cybersecurity.  
It includes coursework, hands-on labs, portfolio projects, notes, and personal study materials accumulated over time.

## 🎯 **Goal**

My primary goal is to build a strong foundation in cybersecurity and develop the technical skills, documentation habits, and real-world problem-solving abilities necessary to transition into a cybersecurity role.  

This repository will grow to include:
- ✅ Coursework from structured programs (e.g., Google Cybersecurity Certificate)  
- 🧪 Hands-on labs and write-ups (TryHackMe, Blue Team Labs, homelab projects)  
- 📂 Portfolio pieces demonstrating practical skills  
- 📝 Study notes, scripts, and other learning artifacts
